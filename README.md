# AudioMirror

This repo contains a lightweight 'mirror' of my Audio (Music) folder, in which I keep my music library.

Each audio file in my music library is mirrored by an XML file in this repo containing the track's metadata (e.g. title, artist, genre etc.).

This allows to me share my music library information and how it is organised without having to provide the actual audio files.
