# Audio Mirror

This repo contains a lightweight 'mirror' of my Audio (Music) folder, in which I keep my music library.

- Each audio file in my music library is mirrored by an XML file in this repo containing the track's metadata (e.g. title, artist, genre etc.).

- This repo allows me to share my music library information and how it is organised without having to provide the actual audio files.

This mirror is generated by **[AudioManager](https://github.com/DavoDC/AudioManager)**.

- **Note:** This mirror was originally included in that repo, but was split into this repo around February 2025.
